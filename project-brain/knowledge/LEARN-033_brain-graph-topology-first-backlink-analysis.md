## Discovery

The brain's link graph has a clear hub-and-spoke topology with two dominant hubs, a long tail of moderately-connected files, and 8 quiet files (0 inbound links) that cluster by type. RULEs are disproportionately quiet (3 of 4 = 75%) compared to LEARNs (4 of 32 = 12.5%), suggesting RULE files may be structurally leaf-type — they consume knowledge but don't generate references.

## Context

After implementing P0.3 (backlinks on all 43 fat index entries), we ran `/brain-status` for the first time with the new quiet file detection (P1.4). This produced the first empirical graph topology data for the brain.

## Evidence

### Hub Structure
| File | Inbound Links | Role |
|------|--------------|------|
| SPEC-000 | 33 | Foundational hub — linked by nearly every file |
| LEARN-005 | 16 | Secondary hub — Claude Code best practices, referenced by all CC subsystem files |
| LEARN-002 | 11 | Tertiary hub — competitive landscape, referenced by research files |
| LEARN-008 | 6 | Minor hub — hooks system |
| LEARN-006 | 6 | Minor hub — memory system |
| LEARN-007 | 6 | Minor hub — skills system |

### Quiet Files (0 inbound links)
| File | Type | Pattern |
|------|------|---------|
| SPEC-002 | SPEC | Recent architect-agent output, not yet referenced |
| RULE-002 | RULE | Leaf-type: consumes knowledge, not referenced |
| RULE-003 | RULE | Leaf-type: consumes knowledge, not referenced |
| RULE-004 | RULE | Leaf-type: consumes knowledge, not referenced |
| LEARN-022 | LEARN | DSPy optimizers — niche topic, not yet connected |
| LEARN-027 | LEARN | Multi-agent orchestration — recent research, not yet referenced |
| LEARN-029 | LEARN | Git worktrees — recent research, not yet referenced |
| LEARN-030 | LEARN | BM25/hybrid search — recent research, not yet referenced |

### Quiet File Patterns by Type
| Type | Total | Quiet | % Quiet |
|------|-------|-------|---------|
| SPEC | 4 | 1 | 25% |
| RULE | 4 | 3 | 75% |
| LEARN | 32 | 4 | 12.5% |
| LOG | 3 | 0 | 0% |

### Link Density vs Benchmarks
LEARN-031 cites Zettelkasten benchmarks: 2-3 links minimum, 4-6 good. Our brain averages ~3.5 forward links per file (from `<!-- links: -->` frontmatter). Inbound links are heavily skewed — median ~2, mean ~3.3, driven up by the hubs.

### Tag Clusters (5+ files)
Largest cluster: `claude-code` at 14 files — candidate for first sub-index if squeeze point is reached.

## Impact

- **Validates LEARN-032 Rule 6:** Topological decay detection works — quiet files are identifiable and cluster meaningfully by type.
- **RULE files may need different treatment:** 75% quiet rate suggests RULEs are structurally terminal (they're referenced BY source LEARNs but don't get referenced FROM other files). This may be healthy, not decaying.
- **Recent research files are predictably quiet:** LEARN-022, 027, 029, 030 are all from the last research batch and haven't been referenced yet because no SPEC or implementation work has consumed them. They'll naturally gain backlinks when Prover implementation begins.
- **SPEC-002 quiet is notable:** It was generated by the architect agent and hasn't been referenced by any other file — worth adding links from SPEC-001 or future Coder brain work.

## Action Taken

- Data captured in this file for longitudinal comparison after future consolidations.
- No immediate action on quiet files — most are explained by type (RULEs) or recency (batch 2 research).
- SPEC-002 flagged for link enrichment when Coder brain work begins.

## Findings

### RULEs are structurally leaf-type (preliminary)
The 75% quiet rate for RULEs is not decay — it's structural. RULEs consume knowledge from LEARNs and SPECs but are rarely referenced by other knowledge files. They are downstream endpoints (applied patterns), not hubs or connectors. This means quiet-file detection in `/brain-status` should treat RULEs differently: a quiet RULE is normal, a quiet LEARN is a flag.

### `claude-code` cluster is first sub-index candidate
At 14 files, the `claude-code` tag cluster is the largest and the first candidate for sub-indexing when the P3 threshold (SPEC-003) is reached. Monitor whether the fat index can still capture distinctions within this cluster.

## Known Issues

- Does hub structure change after consolidation? (Unknown — need to re-run after next consolidation pass)
- What backlink count separates "quiet" from "healthy"? (Currently using 0 as threshold — may need refinement)
